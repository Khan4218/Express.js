âš¡ Express.js Journey

Welcome to my Express.js Journey â€” a hands-on learning path exploring how to build efficient, scalable web applications using Express.js, the fast and minimalist Node.js framework.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The goal of this project is to master backend development by understanding how Express handles routing, middleware, APIs, and database connections.
Every commit represents a real learning milestone â€” from setting up the first route to building dynamic RESTful APIs.

ðŸ§  What I Learned

Setting up and configuring an Express.js server

Creating and managing routes and middleware

Handling HTTP requests and responses

Building RESTful APIs and connecting them with databases

Working with error handling, environment variables, and modular architecture

ðŸª„ Why This Matters

Learning Express.js is a key step in becoming a Full Stack Developer.
It bridges the gap between the frontend and database, allowing me to build complete, production-ready applications with Node.js and modern frameworks like React or Next.js.

ðŸ§© Tech Stack

Node.js â€” JavaScript runtime environment

Express.js â€” Web application framework

Postman â€” For testing routes and APIs

VS Code â€” Development environment
