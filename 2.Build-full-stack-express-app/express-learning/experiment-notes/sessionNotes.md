🔍 1. app.use(session(...))

This sets up Express Session middleware, which means every request that hits your app will pass through this and get a req.session object you can use to store user data (like req.session.userId).

⸻

🧩 2. secret: secret

This is a secret key used to sign and encrypt the session ID stored in the browser cookie.
	•	Prevents tampering (people can’t modify the cookie to impersonate another user).
	•	It’s typically stored in .env as:

SPIRAL_SESSION_SECRET=mySuperSecretKey


⚙️ 3. resave: false
	•	If false → the session won’t be saved again to the store if nothing has changed.
	•	Saves resources and prevents unnecessary database writes.

🧍‍♂️ 4. saveUninitialized: false
	•	If false → a new, empty session won’t be saved to the store until you actually add data (like req.session.userId = 1).
	•	Helps reduce clutter in your session storage (no blank sessions).


🍪 5. cookie: { ... }

This configures how the browser cookie (that holds the session ID) behaves.

a. httpOnly: true

👉 Makes the cookie inaccessible to JavaScript in the browser.
✅ Security feature — prevents XSS attacks from stealing your session ID.

b. secure: false

👉 If true, the cookie is only sent over HTTPS.
❗ Set this to true in production when your app runs over HTTPS.
For local development (localhost), it’s fine as false.

c. sameSite: 'lax'

👉 Controls cross-site request behavior.
	•	'lax' means the cookie is not sent with most cross-site requests but is sent when you navigate directly to your site (safe default).
	•	Prevents some CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.

⸻

🧠 In short:

This session setup ensures:
	•	User login persists across requests and reloads.
	•	Cookies are secure and only used by your site.
	•	You don’t waste memory saving empty sessions.
